2025/26
Pre-requisite qualifications
None, but a grade C in the GSCE examination in Chemistry or Integrated Science would be advantageous
This module is not approved as a discovery module
Module summary
CHEM1821 is one of three foundation courses in chemistry which can be taken by itself or with CHEM1811 and CHEM1831 in any combination. Although a GCSE in science would certainly be advantageous, no prior knowledge of the subject is assumed.
This 10-credit module in semester 1 provides an elementary, essentially non-mathematical introduction to modern concepts of physical chemistry.
You will discover the background to the gas laws, atomic and molecular theory, kinetic theory, chemical kinetics, chemical equilibrium, hermochemistry, and the behaviour of ions in solution, acids and bases. You will also gain experience of simple manipulations in the chemical laboratory.
The School of Chemistry in Leeds is at the forefront of research into the atmosphere, which is now seen as so important to even our very future existence, using advanced ideas which develop from the material in this module.
Objectives
To provide an elementary, essentially non-mathematical introduction to modern concepts of physical chemistry.
Syllabus
An elementary introduction to the gas laws, early atomic and molecular theory, kinetic theory, chemical kinetics, chemical equilibrium, thermochemistry, behaviour of ions in solution, acids and bases.

Module summary
CHEM0831 is one of three foundation courses in chemistry which can be taken by itself or with CHEM0811 and CHEM0821 in any combination. Although a GCSE in science would certainly be advantageous, no prior knowledge of the subject is assumed.
Do you wonder what lies behind the vast array of living things that you encounter every day of your life?
Organic chemistry is one important branch of the subject which studies the chemistry of living things in particular. It's amazing when you stop to think that one element, carbon, has such a vast chemistry that it is the basis for all the living organisms.
Today, organic chemistry is a field of immense importance to technology; the chemistry of drugs, paper, ink, paints, plastics, petrol, tyres, dyes; of the food we eat and the clothing we wear. If you would like to explore the fascinating science of the living materials that make up the world around you then this 10-credit module of lectures in semester 2 is for you.
Objectives
To introduce elementary organic chemistry to students who have no previous knowledge of the subject. This will enable students to proceed to further modules of organic chemistry.
Syllabus
The unique position of carbon in the Periodic Table and the bonding of carbon compounds will be discussed.
Some typical reactions of organic molecules will be described, and the electron movements in these reactions will be highlighted.

During an industrial placement year of an integrated Masters programme, students complete distance learning coursework which is returned to the School for marking. Marks for this work are returned to the students within 4 weeks of submission, in addition to detailed feedback on the work.
Objectives
To provide students with educational resources in the main branches of the subject (organic, inorganic and physical) which are appropriate to level 3 of an integrated masters programme and which will provide useful background for the level 4 options which students will study on their return to Leeds.
Learning outcomes
Students will improve their skills in independent study. Students will enhance their background knowledge in areas of the subject which may include; chemical bonding, molecular self-organization, chemical kinetics, organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, molecular symmetry, organometallic chemistry, solid-state inorganic chemistry, analytical chemistry and atmospheric chemistry. Students will develop improved problem-solving skills in some of these areas.
Syllabus
Students will choose six topics from a list which may include: chemical bonding, molecular self-organization, chemical kinetics, organic synthesis, medicinal chemistry, molecular symmetry, organometallic chemistry, solid-state inorganic chemistry, analytical chemistry and atmospheric chemistry. The syllabus from each topic will include a selection of material which is also taught on level 3 modules for Leeds-based (non-placement) students (with which modules the current module is, thus, mutually exclusive).

Private study
Students will be given a list of ethical issues from which to state their preference for one that will be the subject of their research over the course of the semester. Working in teams of approximately five, they will have five one-hour meetings with a supervisor who will be able to guide them on readings and areas of potential interest. As they represent a mix of Philosophy and Chemistry, the supervisors will be able to direct students to theoretical, contemporary and historical issues that will direct their study. At each tutorial a different student will be expected to present on a paper they have read for discussion with the group.
Opportunities for Formative Feedback
Progress will be monitored through five one-hour tutorials to be held with each team (i.e. theme-related) at which a different student each week will present on a set reading. The remaining students will then be expected to discuss the paper in the tutorial with guidance from the tutor. Presentations will be given mid-way through the research period to ensure that students are on-track with their timing and to provide mutual encouragement and information as to each other's work. The tutorials will also be used to prepare students for and debrief after the presentations.

CHEM8100 Industrial Placement
This module is not approved as a discovery module
Objectives
On completion of this module, students will have gained an insight into the relevance and application of chemistry in industry. They will have developed a wide range of new skills, and experienced the application of chemical knowledge in a work-based environment appropriate to the programme of study.
They will also have developed and practised personal transferable skills such as identifying objectives, negotiating the strategy and tactics to be used in achieving such objectives, written and oral communication, and working within a team in an industrial laboratory environment.
Learning outcomes
Precise knowledge outcomes will be dependent on the type of research project undertaken by the student at the company. Most commonly this will involve either organic synthesis, analytical science, or computational chemistry, although placements in other types of chemistry are also available.
A synthesis placement will train the students in particular aspects of advanced organic chemistry, and the practical methods for preparing and analysing organic molecules. An analytical chemistry placement will afford advanced knowledge of one or more spectroscopic or analytical methods, for the analysis of laboratory or environmental samples, plus a more general training in the practise of chemical analysis. A computational chemistry placement will provide insights into chemistry-related data analysis or modelling methodologies.
To ensure appropriate knowledge outcomes, students on the Medicinal Chemistry (Industry programme will have a restricted choice of placement project related to those degree specialisms.
Syllabus
The programme of work carried out during the placement will be agreed by arrangement with the student, academic supervisor and industrial supervisor within the overall objectives described above.
