Module catalogue","<think>
Okay, let me think through this query carefully. The user is asking about the credit value of a specific module code CHEM2112, and they've provided clear instructions on how to handle it.

Looking at the context, I see there's an undergraduate module catalogue but no direct mention of CHEM2112 credits in any quoted line. There are references to other modules like CHEM2113 with 20 credits, but nothing about CHEM2112 itself.

Hmm, this is interesting because while the context shows how to handle credit information for other modules (like using ""Credits: X"" or aggregating across similar codes), there's no direct data for CHEM2112. The user specifically asked about this module code, so I can't infer from related modules without explicit confirmation.

The instructions are clear - if the answer isn't explicitly supported, respond with ""I don't know."" Since there's no mention of CHEM2112 credits in the provided context lines, that seems to be the only appropriate response here. No speculation about credit values is allowed according to the rules.

This also makes me think about how module catalogues typically work - they usually list each code separately rather than cross-referencing them. Without seeing CHEM2112 listed with its credits somewhere in the context, I can't provide an answer.

Answer: I don't know.

Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking how many second-year modules are available. I need to check the provided context for any information related to module levels or years.

Looking through the context, there's a mention of ""CHEM2242 Introduction to Drug Design"" with 10 credits and taught in Semester 2 under the year running 2025/26. The prerequisite qualifications are listed as ""---"", which might mean none specified here. But the key point is that this module code starts with CHEM2, indicating it's a second-year chemistry module.

However, there's no explicit count of modules in any category (first-year, second-year, etc.). The context doesn't list all modules or categorize them by year. Without knowing how many other second-year modules exist beyond this one example, I can't provide an accurate number. 

The user might be assuming that the presence of a single CHEM2xx module implies there are several, but without data on total offerings, it's impossible to confirm. The disclaimer and errors section don't help here either. Since the context doesn't specify the total count or list all second-year modules, I should respond with ""I don't know."" 

Also, checking if any other CHEM2xx modules are mentioned in the context? No, only this one is listed. So even though it's a second-year module, there's no way to determine how many others exist without additional information.
</think>
Answer: The provided context does not specify the number of available second-year modules.

Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking if there are any first-year modules assessed by 100% coursework.

First, I need to check the provided context for information about first-year modules and their assessment methods. Looking through the CHEM2131 module details, it says ""CHEM2131 Chemical Kinetics and Thermodynamics"" with 10 credits, taught in Semester 1 of 2025/26. The pre-requisite is Level 1 Chemistry or equivalent, which typically means first year.

Now, the assessment section for CHEM2131: Report (Written Report) - 15%, Written Work (compulsory coursework) - 0%, and Open Book exam - 85%. So here, there's an exam component. The user is asking about a module assessed entirely by coursework, but this one has both coursework and an exam.

The context doesn't mention any other modules. There's no explicit statement that another first-year module uses only coursework. The general principles say to respond with ""I don't know"" if not supported. Since CHEM2131 is a first-year module (Level 1) but has mixed assessment, and there's no information about another module being entirely coursework-based, I can't confirm any such module exists.

Also, the user might be concerned about avoiding exams or looking for modules with different assessment structures. They could be a student trying to find easier grading options. But without specific data on other first-year modules in the context, it's impossible to answer definitively.
</think>
Answer: No information is available about any 10-credit (first-year) module assessed entirely by coursework.

Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a summary of topics covered across all first-year chemistry modules based on the provided context.

First, I need to check if there's any information in the given context about multiple first-year modules. Looking through the content, I see that the module code is CHEM1102 and it covers specific topics like IR and Raman spectroscopy, polymer chemistry, and solution equilibria. There's no mention of other modules or their syllabi here.

The user mentioned to prefer lines from a specific module if named, but since they didn't specify one, I should look for general information across all first-year modules. However, the context only includes details about CHEM1102 and doesn't list any other modules. There's no aggregated data or cross-module summary provided.

The instructions say to respond with ""I don't know"" if the answer isn't explicitly supported by the context. Since there's no information on other first-year chemistry modules, I can't aggregate their topics. The example given in the system prompt uses a specific module's details, but here we're asked about all modules without any data.

Therefore, because the context doesn't provide syllabi or topics for multiple modules, it's impossible to answer the question accurately.
</think>
Answer: Insufficient information provided to determine the topics covered across all first-year chemistry modules. Only one module (CHEM1102) is detailed in the context.

About us","<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking if there are any modules specifically about nanotechnology in the provided context.

First, I'll scan through the given context to find any mention of nanotechnology-related modules. Looking at the module codes and titles listed—CHEM1102 Chemistry in Action: Atoms, Molecules, Matter comes to mind. The credits here are 10, which is straightforward from the text. 

Next, I need to check if there's any direct reference to nanotechnology in this context. Scanning through the details of CHEM1102, including prerequisites, replaced modules, and assessment methods, none mention nanotech explicitly. There's a disclaimer about errors or omissions, but that doesn't help here.

Since no module code or title directly references nanotechnology, I can't confirm its existence based on this context alone. The user might be looking for specific courses related to nanotech, perhaps for their studies or research. Without explicit information, the safest answer is ""I don't know."" 

But wait, could there be other modules in the catalogue that aren't listed here? The context only includes a snippet of the module list and one detailed module (CHEM1102). Since I can't access beyond this provided text, I must stick to what's given. There's no mention elsewhere of nanotechnology modules.

So, even though CHEM1102 is about chemistry concepts that might relate broadly to materials science including nanotech, the absence of explicit terms means I can't assume or infer its content. The user needs precise information based on the context provided, and since it's not there, responding with ""I don't know"" is correct.
</think>
Answer: No modules are explicitly mentioned as being about nanotechnology in this context.

Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking how to identify second-year modules based on the provided context.

First, I need to check if there's any information in the given context that directly addresses which modules are for second year. Looking through the content, there's a mention of ""CHEM0831 Elementary Organic Chemistry (IFY)"" and it says ""Taught: Semester 2"". However, semester doesn't necessarily mean second year unless specified elsewhere.

The user might be assuming that semester indicates the year level, but in academic catalogues, modules can be taught in semesters across different years. For example, a first-year module could also have classes in semester two if it's split. Without explicit information linking the semester to the year (like ""Year 1"" or ""Second Year""), I can't confirm that CHEM0831 is second-year.

Also, there are other modules listed but no details about their years except for this one having semester two taught in 2025/26. Since the context doesn't specify which modules belong to which year level, and only provides teaching semesters without direct year correlation, I don't have enough information here to answer accurately.

The user might need a way to distinguish second-year modules from others, but since there's no clear method in the provided data (like module codes indicating year or explicit descriptions), I can't provide an answer. The safest response is ""I don't know"" because any other conclusion would be speculative.

Answer: I don't know.
