In science new insights often involve taking lots of data and bringing it together in a way that illuminates the problem.  In this course you will develop the core skills to efficiently handle large datasets.  Using examples from across Chemistry you will see how to efficiently extract data using simple programming in python and reach meaningful conclusions. Online tools will help you acquire key skills while weekly seminars will let you explore real examples, enabling you use these skills to answer scientific questions. '
